- Just unzip the `03_ros/turtle_party.zip` folder under your workspace's source folder and build it by following the commands at the end of the `a3_ros.ipynb`.
- You can find the TF topics graph in the `03_ros/rosgraph.png` file.
- the `03_ros/ws` is the ros workspace I used for development. You may simply ignore it.
